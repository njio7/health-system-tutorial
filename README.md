to start,

after this, you will want to create a plane, a cube and two more cubes beside the main player.

you can place them wherever you want but i have set mine up like this.

to make things visually clearer, we can create a new material and then assign a new colour to our cubes. 

for my example, i will be using green and red cubes to make it clear whhich cube will give our player health and which cube with remove health from the player.

this is how my scene looks once things have been put into place.

after creating eveything we need for our scene, we can move onto giving the player a collider that will trigger when it touches either the green or red cube.

when clicking on both the red and green cube, you will want to make sure that the "Is Trigger" box is ticked to make sure that the player cube will be able to interact with it.
